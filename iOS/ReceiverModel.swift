// The iOS app's view model around StreamReceiver: it owns the receiver,
// announces the panel, and translates scene/lock lifecycle into the
// receiver's sleep, pause and shutdown calls.
//
// Moved out of OpenSidecarPhoneApp.swift unchanged apart from the two init
// parameters. Design Canvas's iPad app is a second receiver on the same
// core, and it listens on its own port and advertises its own Bonjour type
// (plan ruling 1 — a USB dial carries no service type, so only a different
// port keeps the two products from dialling each other).

    // still accepts the Mac's redials, so the session survives untouched
    // until we return. Only a device lock (deliberate "screen off") or the
    // app being quit ends the session. Known hole: a lock that happens
    // after we're already suspended is undetectable — no code runs and the
    // kernel behaves identically — so the display stays up until the user
    // returns or the app dies.
